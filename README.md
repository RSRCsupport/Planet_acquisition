# Planet_acquisition
This repository describes ways to acquire Planet satellite data using two (2) versions of the Planet API refered to as the "new" and the "old" ones. Below step-by-step guide how to use these API to download bulk data from planet.

There are common steps for both the new and the old API.

1) Download Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/download/): it comes with a nice suit of packages with python distribution. Install the 32 version for python 2.7 as the 64 bit will conflict with your Arcmap distribution. If you are not doing anything with arcpy then get the 64 bit. It's better and include a Jupiter Console
